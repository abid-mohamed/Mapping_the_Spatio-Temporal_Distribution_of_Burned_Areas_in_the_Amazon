# About the Data
The dataset includes 10 variables that capture various factors related to fires, land use, environmental conditions, and climate. It provides a spatial resolution of 500 meters, allowing a detailed analysis of the Amazon rainforest. These variables are measured on a monthly basis, covering the entire period from 2001 to 2020.

- **Burnt Area**: Represents the extent of burned areas in the Amazon rainforest, categorized as burnt (1), unburnt (0), missing (-1), or water (-2).

- **Land Cover**: A categorical variable with 11 classes, providing information on different land cover types such as water, urban, forest, grassland, and more.

- **Precipitation**: Measured in millimeters per hour, with a range between 0 and 3300.

- **Soil Moisture**: Measured in millimeters, with missing values marked as -9.99e+08, and a range between 0 and 4291.

- **Elevation**: Measured in meters, with a range between -85 and 6471.

- **Land Surface Temperature**: Represented in Kelvin, with values adjusted by a scale factor of 0.02. Different months have varying missing data.

- **Specific Humidity**: Represented as kg/kg, indicating the ratio of kilograms of water (moisture) per kilogram of air. It ranges from 9.59e-04 to 2.15e-02.

- **Evapotranspiration**: Measured in kg/m2s, with values ranging between -2.02e-07 and 9.69e-05.
