# Mapping the Spatio-Temporal Distribution of Fires in the Amazon from 2001 to 2020: An Ensemble Modeling Approach"

## Overview
This project was conducted during my 6-month internship at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST). It was supervised by Prof. Paula Moraga and Dr. Jonatan A. Gonz√°lez.

The primary objective of this project was to develop an ensemble modeling approach to predict forest fires in the Amazon rainforest, leveraging data spanning from 2001 to 2020. By integrating various environmental and climatic factors, we aimed to create a comprehensive model that could provide valuable insights into the occurrence of forest fires in this vital ecosystem.

## Data Source
For this project, we utilized the dataset provided by Mateen Mahmood and Prof. Paula Moraga. The dataset is a raster-based resource for spatio-temporal analysis of forest fires in the Amazon rainforest from 2001 to 2020. You can find the data on Zenodo at the following DOI: [Dataset on Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7215402).

## Tools and Packages
To implement this project, we primarily used the R programming language. The following R packages were instrumental in our data analysis, modeling, and visualization: terra, raster, sf, H2O, rsample, recipes, data.table, tidyverse, pROC, doParallel, doSNOW, ggplot2, tidyterra. <br />
These packages facilitated various aspects of our project
